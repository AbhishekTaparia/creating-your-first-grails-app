Grails is an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[Model View Controller] (MVC) framework, based upon the Spring Boot project. However, Grails goes farther than most frameworks by following a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration["Convention over Configuration"] approach to development. This means that for many artefact types in Grails (controllers, views, etc), you simply create a file in a particular directory in your project, and Grails will automatically wire it into your application without any additional configuration on your part.

When building a MVC application, it is typical to start with the "M" (Model), also known as the "Domain model". In Grails, your domain model is defined with Groovy classes under `grails-app/domain`. Let's create a domain class.

Domain classes can be generated by Grails (in which case Grails will helpfully create a unit test automatically), or you can simply create the file yourself.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./grailsw create-domain-class com.example.Vehicle

| Created grails-app/domain/com/example/Vehicle.groovy
| Created src/test/groovy/com/example/VehicleSpec.groovy
----

This will generate two Groovy files, one being our domain class, and the other a unit test. Let's see what our domain class looks like.

[source, groovy]
----
package com.example

class Vehicle {

    static constraints = {
    }
}
----

Right now our domain class has no properties, and no constraints. That's not very interesting, but it's worth noting that this is all that's needed to wire up a persistent domain class in our application. By default, Hibernate will be used to configure a datasource (an in-memory H2 database by default) and create tables and associations for all Groovy classes under `grails-app/domain`. Let's add some properties to this domain class:

[source, groovy]
----
package com.example

class Vehicle {

    String name //<1>

    String make
    String model

    static constraints = {
        name maxSize: 255  //<2>
        make inList: ['Ford', 'Chevrolet', 'Nissan']
        model nullable: true
    }
}
----
<1> Properties will be used to create columns in the database (assuming a relational database is used)
<2> Constraints will be used to enforce valid data in each field

Please see the Grails documentation for a complete list and documentation of how to use https://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Domain%20Classes/Usage.html[domain classes] and https://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Constraints/Usage.html[constraints]

If you run the app again, you should see the same page as before. However, you can login to the DB Console and view your new database table.

Browse to `http://localhost:8080/dbconsole` and login. The default username is `sa`, without a password. The default JDBC URL is: `jdbc:h2:mem:devDb;MVCC=TRUE;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE`

NOTE: You can view the JDBC url in `application.yml`, under `environments.development.dataSource.url`

Once you've logged in to the DB Console, you should see your new `VEHICLES` table in the left-hand sidebar. Click the `+` icon to expand the table - you should see a list of columns, including the three `String` fields we just defined, `name`, `make,` and `model`.
