Now that you've created (or downloaded) your Grails project, it's time to run it and see what Grails has already given you.

If you have a local installation of Grails, you can run the app using the `run-app` command from within your project:

[source, bash]
----
$ cd myApp/
$ grails run-app
----

However, just as you do not need a Grails installation to create a Grails app (if you download it from the http://start.grails.org[Grails Application Forge], for example), you do not need to have a Grails installation to run the app (or any other Grails commands either. You can use the http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/introduction.html#whatsNewGrailsWrapper[Grails Wrapper] to run any Grails command from within a Grails project (as of 3.2.3).

[source, bash]
----
$ ./grailsw run-app
----

You can also use Grails' http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/commandLine.html#interactiveMode[Interactive Mode] to run the Grails runtime, from which you can issue any Grails command without waiting for the runtime to spin up for each task. In this guide we will be preferring the Grails wrapper for most commands.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./grailsw

| Enter a command name to run. Use TAB for completion:
grails>run-app      //you can shutdown the app with the stop-app command
----

Finally, because Grails is built upon https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] and https://gradle.org/[Gradle], you can also use Spring Boot commands like `bootRun` to interact with your Grails application.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

Once you've run any of those commands, Grails will launch your application using an embedded Tomcat server, and make it available (by default) at `http://localhost:8080`.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./grailsw run-app

| Running application...
Grails application running at http://localhost:8080 in environment: development
----

If you'd like to change the port number, simply edit the `application.yml` file under `grails-app/conf/`, and add the following line:

[source, yml]
----
server:
    port: 8090
----

Currently the app simply displays a default index page with some information about the application. The default index page is located under `grails-app/views/index.gsp`.

Go ahead and edit that file, and change some thing on the page, as shown below (line 54):

[source, xml]
----
    <div id="content" role="main">
        <section class="row colset-2-its">
            <h1>Welcome to My First Grails Project</h1>  <1>
----
<1> Change the text of the `<h1>` tag.

Save your changes and refresh the page in the browser. You should see your change on the home page. Grails will auto-reload changes to views, controllers, domain classes and other artefacts when it detects changes, so you don't need to restart the app upon every change.

WARNING: Major changes to domain class associations, renaming classes, and other operations that affect the "wiring" of the application may not successfully reload.
